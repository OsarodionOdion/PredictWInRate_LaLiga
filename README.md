Project Title

Predicting Season Points for the 2017/2018 Spanish la liga season

Executive Summary of the Proposed Project

The Spanish la liga is often referred to as the most competitive football (soccer) league in the world. Home to the most successful football teams in Europe, the league is often considered the toughest. Winning the league requires acquiring the most points from all games played in the season. For every season, there is a total of 38 games for every team .i.e. 19 home games and 19 away games. For every team, a win earns 3 points, a draw earns 1 point and a loss earns 0 point.
With lesser goals scored and more goals conceded than the runner-up, Real Madrid was the crowned champion of the 2016-2017 la liga Season. 2017-2018 season was won by Barcelona with more goals scored and more goals conceded than the runner-up (Atletico Madrid). However, Real Madrid ended the season in 3rd place having scored 30 goals more than the runner-up, and 5 goals less than the season champion.
This project analyzes different match statistics and their effects on the number of points earned in a season. It covers the use of R in creating different predictive models, and the use of these models in predicting season points for different seasons.
